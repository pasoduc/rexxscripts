# rexxscripts

Learning rexx for fun. Primarily reading through Howard Fosdick's Rexx Programmer's Reference. 

Here's a link: https://www.wiley.com/en-us/Rexx+Programmer's+Reference-p-9780764579967
And another one: https://www.amazon.com/Rexx-Programmers-Reference-Howard-Fosdick/dp/0764579967

If you haven't played around with rexx, I recommend doing so. It's a pretty simple programming language. Simple, but fun. Arrays are pretty different.

Other languages I find interesting are: APL, SNOBOL/Icon, and Smalltalk
